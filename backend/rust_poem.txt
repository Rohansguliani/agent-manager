In systems' realm, where dangers lurk unseen,
A language rises, vibrant, sharp, and keen.
With memory safe, no nulls to dread or fear,
Rust stands a guardian, holding errors clear.

From humble CLI to web's expansive might,
It crafts with care, in darkness brings the light.
Concurrency flows, without a race in sight,
Through ownership's grace, it guides the code aright.

A borrow checker, stern but ever true,
Ensures the data's handled, fresh and new.
Performance gleams, a speed that can't be beat,
For tasks demanding, swift and ever fleet.

A growing crate-verse, rich with tools and lore,
Empowers builders, asking for no more.
So raise a glass, to Rust, the modern art,
A language forged with passion, mind, and heart.
