//! Orchestrator module
//!
//! Contains reusable primitives for orchestrating multi-step operations.
//! This module provides building blocks that can be composed to create
//! orchestration workflows.
//!
//! The primitives are intentionally designed to be reusable and testable,
//! making it easy to refactor to a generic orchestrator in future versions.
