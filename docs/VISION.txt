# Vision: Chat and Coding Workflow Manager for CLI LLMs

## Core Concept

A chat and coding workflow manager that uses CLI LLMs (like Gemini CLI) and can be managed remotely. This solves two problems with one solution:

1. **CLI tools lack GUI/history**: Terminal-only tools don't provide conversation history, visual interfaces, or easy searchability
2. **Can't manage code remotely from phone**: CLI workflows are desktop-bound - there's no way to review, manage, or continue work from a phone/tablet remotely

## The "Two Birds, One Stone" Approach

By wrapping CLI tools in a web interface with remote access, we solve both problems simultaneously:
- **GUI/History Layer**: Web interface adds conversation history, searchable past interactions, and visual workflow management
- **Remote Access**: Manage and monitor CLI agents from anywhere via phone, tablet, or other devices
- **Local-First**: Agents still execute locally on your machine, keeping your data private and secure

## Value Proposition

### Primary Value: Enhanced CLI Experience
- Better UX for CLI LLM tools (visual interface, history, search)
- Conversation persistence across sessions
- Visual orchestration of CLI workflows

### Secondary Value: Remote Access
- Monitor agent executions from phone/tablet
- Review code changes and outputs remotely
- Continue conversations or start new ones from any device
- Note: Full coding workflows on phone are challenging - focus is on monitoring/review, not active development

## Technical Approach

- **Wrap, Don't Rebuild**: Leverage existing CLI tools (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Ollama, etc.) rather than reimplementing them
- **Web Interface**: React-based UI accessible from any device
- **Local Execution**: CLI agents run on local machine, web UI provides remote interface
- **Streaming**: Real-time output streaming for immediate feedback

## Target Users

- Developers working with CLI-based LLM tools who want better UX
- Users who want to manage agents from phone/tablet while away from their computer
- Teams managing agent-based workflows who need remote collaboration
- Users needing visual orchestration of CLI agents with mobile/remote access

## Key Strengths

✅ **Solves Real Pain Points**: Addresses legitimate frustrations with CLI-only tools
✅ **Reuses Existing Tools**: Leverages proven CLI LLMs rather than rebuilding
✅ **Local-First Privacy**: Data stays on your machine, only UI is accessed remotely
✅ **Flexible Integration**: Any CLI tool can be wrapped, not limited to specific LLMs

## Important Considerations

⚠️ **Security**: Remote access exposes CLI execution - needs careful authentication and isolation
⚠️ **Mobile UX**: Full terminals/coding on small screens has limitations - focus on monitoring/review vs active coding
⚠️ **Complexity**: Adding web UI + remote access + CLI execution creates operational overhead

## Vision Focus

**Primary**: Better UX/history for CLI tools (local-first experience)
**Secondary**: Remote monitoring/review capabilities (enhancement, not replacement)

This vision optimizes for improving the CLI experience locally, with remote access as a powerful enhancement for monitoring and light management tasks rather than attempting to enable full coding workflows on mobile devices.
